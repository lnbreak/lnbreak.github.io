            <h1>WHAT IS HUMAN TRAFFICKING?</h1>
            <br /><br />
            It involves recruitment, harbouring or transporting people into a situation of exploitation 
            through the use of violence, deception or coercion and forced to work against their will.
            <br /><br />
            In other words, trafficking is a process of enslaving people, coercing them into a situation 
            with no way out and exploiting them.
            <br /><br />
            People can be trafficked for many different formns of exploitation such as forced prostitution, 
            forced labour, forced begging, forced criminality, domestic servitude, forced marriage, and 
            forced organ removal.
            <br /><br />
            Contrary to a common misconception, people don't necessarily have to be transported across borders 
            for trafficking to take place.
            <br /><br />
            In fact, transporting or moving the victim doesn't necessarily define 
            trafficking.
            <br /><br />
            When children are trafficked, no violence nor coercion needs to be involved. Simply bring them into 
            exploitative conditions constitutes trafficking.
